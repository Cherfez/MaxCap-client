# MaxCap.

A booking app for climbing gyms during the COVID-19 period. This is the client code.

MaxCap. will let climbers make a booking to a specific gym. The gym can set different timeslots for each day. Per timeslot there can be a maximum capacity set, so that the amount of climbers per session is in line with the set regulations during the COVID-19 period.
When a climber has booked a session they will recieve an email with the confirmation. The made bookings can be re-visited on the profile of the logged in user. Here is it also possible to delete a specific timeslot.
